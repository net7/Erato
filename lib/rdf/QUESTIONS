SPEC SESAME
1) Sesame RDF Store and size, did he consider it as a problem?

* rdf-spec lib/rdf/spec/enumerable.rb *
2) Line 69: shouldn't it use @enumerable.statements instead of
   @statements? Problems with blank nodes ids that get renamed in
   Sesame.
3) Same for 117 for problem 1) (which should not be checked for
   here). Sesame uses inference _and_ add some triples on its own.
4) Line 122, same as 2).

Line 237

How to build a construct query from patterns like:
_:node15lnq399ox6615 <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/mbox_sha1sum> nil
?

rdf-spec lib/rdf/spec/mutable.rb
11) Line 153, same as 1)



and so on...

extra: accepting a sparql query as string in
RDF::SPARQL::Repository#query. Ok?

@failing_pattern in lib/rdf/spec/queryable.rb, line 149 is valid? 
SPARQL does not like bnodes as predicates...


12) Testing non mutable repository?

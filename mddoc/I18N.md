Talia3 Internationalization
===========================

Introduction
------------

Talia3 uses [Rails: FastGettext](https://github.com/grosser/gettext_i18n_rails_example
Rails: FastGettext) 

Following Talia3 development philosophy, which is that Talia3 should
more of an application, ready to start right after `gem install`,
Rails: FastGetText initialization is already handled by the Talia3 Engine.

Applications that extend Talia3 can of course use, extend or ignore this.
